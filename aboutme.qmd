# Who am I?

Hi everyone! Again, my name is Alexis Gonzalez. I am a student a UGA pursuing a masters degree in public health with a concentration in epidemiology. I currently hold a bachelor of science in microbiology, and work in the field of microbiology with an intersection in public health. My programming experience consists of 2 semesters of graduate level biostatistics using R and SAS. Occasionally, I play around with SQL and Tableau. I look forward to expanding my coding knowledge and putting it to use!

I currently work at the United States Department of Agriculture as a Microbiology Intern. That is mostly where I get to utilize SQL and Tableau! We use it to store and visualize outbreak data, antimicrobial resistance data, and other trends we notice. Before that, I did 2 years of undergraduate research on aquatic microorganisms.

## **Interests/hobbies**

In my free time I like to play video games.

Current game is God of War

I'm an avid baker, my home is constantly stocked with some sort of baked good. In contradiction to that, I am really interested in health and wellness and try to spend time in the gym or outdoors. :)

I look forward to learning and adding to my portfolio!

## Cool data:

I found this a few months ago looking for a coffee shop near me. Someone mapped out basically all of the coffee shops in the atl/metro atl area. I love coffee and cafes so it has definitely come in handy. Its color coded to quickly give an idea of what part of atl the shop is in. Maybe i'll try to visit them all someday...
